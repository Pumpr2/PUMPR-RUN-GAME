# 🦖 Custom Dino Game with Jan Pumpr and Electric Boxes

A fun little 2D browser game inspired by the classic Chrome Dino – now with a twist:

- 🧍‍♂️ **Dino**: A custom character styled after *Jan Pumpr*
- ⚡ **Obstacles**: Replaced by electric switch boxes (*rozvaděče*)

The game runs directly in your browser, tracks your score during the session, and is fully embeddable (e.g., in Google Sites).
